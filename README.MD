# pdf-populator
Python scripts for populating a pdf from an excel spreadsheet

## Installing the program requirements
As of right now there is no executable to run the program with all of the dependencies already installed. Therefore you will need to complete the following:
- Have python installed. Can find the download [here](https://www.python.org/downloads/)
- Open a terminal in the root directoy (where this file is located) and run the following: `pip install requirements.txt`
After completing the above, you should be able to run the program using: `python main.py`
